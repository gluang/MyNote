# 生成器模式
> 亦称：建造者模式、Builder

生成器模式是一种创建型设计模式， 使你能够分步骤创建复杂对象。 该模式允许你**使用相同的创建代码生成不同类型和形式的对象**。

使用生成器模式可避免 “**重叠构造函数** （telescopic constructor）” 的出现。（解决构造函数中多个可选参数的问题）。

# 模式结构

![](images/03-生成器模式.png)

1. 生成器 （Builder） 接口声明在所有类型生成器中通用的产品构造步骤。
2. 具体生成器 （Concrete Builders） 提供构造过程的不同实现。具体生成器也可以构造不遵循通用接口的产品。
3. 产品 （Products） 是最终生成的对象。由不同生成器构造的产品无需属于同一类层次结构或接口。
4. 主管 （Director） 类定义调用构造步骤的顺序，这样你就可以创建和复用特定的产品配置。
5. 客户端 （Client） 必须将某个生成器对象与主管类关联。一般情况下，你只需通过主管类构造函数的参数进行一次性关联即可。此后主管类就能使用生成器对象完成后续所有的构造任务。但在客户端将生成器对象传递给主管类制造方法时还有另一种方式。在这种情况下，你在使用主管类生产产品时每次都可以使用不同的生成器。

 * complex and require extensive configuration.

 * unrelated products. In other words, results of various builders may not
 * always follow the same interface.

     * Usually, after returning the end result to the client, a builder instance
     * is expected to be ready to start producing another product. That's why
     * it's a usual practice to call the reset method at the end of the
     * `getProduct` method body. However, this behavior is not mandatory, and
     * you can make your builders wait for an explicit reset call from the
     * client code before disposing of the previous result.
